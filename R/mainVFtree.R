# mainVFtree.R

#' An main function to plot the Phylogentic Tree with referenced VF genes.
#'
#' \code{mainVFtree} This is the main function for my functions in this
#' package. The function will plot the non-exon position on reference gene and
#' if they are introns (if intronsFile exist).
#'
#' @param readAssemblies The file that store the read sequences, a string.
#' @param readQueries The file that contains the intron sequences, a string.
#' @param style The visualization style of the plot, default is circular style
#' @return A list of list with reference name, alignment position, alignment
#' counts and percentage of introns if there is a verifyDataFrame.

plotVFtree <- function(readAssemblies, readQueries, style = "circular") {
  # preprocess/concatenate two types of inpits


  # Plot according to styles

  # Delete files
