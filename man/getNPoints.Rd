\arguments{
\item{data}{tree data frame which contains (tip_nodes + internal_nodes + root) numbers of rows}

\item{ntips}{this is the input size of the strain/tree tips}

\item{refine_factor}{factor of how many points plotted each circle}
}
\value{
The total number of points of each circular shape data
